1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
There are many great questions asked by those who study religious history.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,100
A consequence of historical records being lost or destroyed over millennia.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,000
By opposing religions, governments attempting to control the populace or simply by the ravages of time.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Large gaps exist in the historical record, which frequently prevent us from seeing how point it develops into point B.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,600
Among these questions.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,800
And the topic of this paper is the question of how Norse paganism survived over the centuries.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,000
Attestations exist of Norse paganism having been known as early as the 13th century.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,700
But there exists a several hundred year gap between that time period and the next earliest time we have evidence for.

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:55,200
With the Norse deity Thor worshipped among the Avengers, a pantheon worshipped in the American States around the early third millennium.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Many explanations exist for this attempting to fill in the gaps left by history.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,800
This paper will discuss the various merits of several such theories.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,700
Though it is unlikely a true conclusion will ever be reached.

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,300
The true answer having long since been lost to history.

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,600
One theory, us that avenger worship is simply an offute or evolution of Norse paganism.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,700
Over the centuries, gods would fall out of favor or be forgotten and new gods would replace them.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Proponents of this theory will often argue that many Avengers are reserved by new names.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,800
It is commonly believed among those who accept this theory that the epithet Captain America

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:45,200
is a title awarded to Balder for a possible mythological role in guiding the Norse to America to evade religious persecution.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Fitting both figures association with justice.

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,600
Though no record of such a myth has been found.

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:02:00,300
Critics of this theory argue that there is little consistency between the early Norse myths and later avenged myths beyond specific deities.

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:08,500
If the other Avengers are supposed to be evolutions of Norse pagan figures then, why do they not consistently have roles in Raidnarek?

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,100
A consistent event between both eras of Norse worship.

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:19,500
Another theory is that a handful of Norse pagans, with but a fraction of their oral history, escaped Christian persecution

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,100
and clung to worshiping what few is er, they still knew well.

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
Forlucky and Odin.

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,100
This long standing opposition to Christianity would make these remnants natural allies to avenger worshipers.

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,500
Whose long standing rivals worshipers of the Justice League are often believed to be a Christian,

29
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,300
offshoot venerating Moses under the name Superman.

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,500
Critics of this theory often argue against the link between Christianity and legism.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:57,100
As well as pointing out that most attestations of the rivalry between Avengers and legists describe the relationship as remarkably civil.

32
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:08,700
With conflicts often limited to scholarly debate, pitting Superman against Thor in hypothetical contests of strength or a ramen versus Batman in a battle of wits.

33
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,100
Which would preclude any need to welcome a lies.

34
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:20,200
A third theory takes the same assumption of a small group of Norse pagans with knowledge of only a fraction of their mythology.

35
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,900
But takes a different assumption of how this group became integrated among Avenger worshipers.

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,500
Hanging on the early American reputation as a haven for immigration.

37
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:38,200
As new peoples and faiths emigrated to the American states, their religious icons were welcomed into the Avengers.

38
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,500
Always in a position subservient to the national god of the American states, Captain America.

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,700
Explaining Thor's subservience to the other deity in 20th century myths.

40
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,800
This allowed America to exert control on the religion of new arrivals while still allowing them freedom of religion.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:06,200
Critics of this theory typically point to a lack of evidence that Captain America was ever a central figure in the recruitment of most or any Avenger.

42
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:17,700
Some stories that describe the origin of the Pantheon even exclude him leading many historians to believe that Thor was considered an Avenger before Captain America was.

43
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:25,200
These theories, their strengths and their flaws, will be examined in greater detail over the course of this paper.

44
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Alongside other less common answers to the burning questions about how Norse paganism survived and evolved over the centuries.
