00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
There are many great questions asked by those who study religious history.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.100
A consequence of historical records being lost or destroyed over millennia.

00:10.100 --> 00:17.000
By opposing religions, governments attempting to control the populace or simply by the ravages of time.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.800
Large gaps exist in the historical record, which frequently prevent us from seeing how point it develops into point B.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.600
Among these questions.

00:26.600 --> 00:32.800
And the topic of this paper is the question of how Norse paganism survived over the centuries.

00:32.800 --> 00:39.000
Attestations exist of Norse paganism having been known as early as the 13th century.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.700
But there exists a several hundred year gap between that time period and the next earliest time we have evidence for.

00:46.700 --> 00:55.200
With the Norse deity Thor worshipped among the Avengers, a pantheon worshipped in the American States around the early third millennium.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.400
Many explanations exist for this attempting to fill in the gaps left by history.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.800
This paper will discuss the various merits of several such theories.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.700
Though it is unlikely a true conclusion will ever be reached.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.300
The true answer having long since been lost to history.

01:12.300 --> 01:18.600
One theory, us that avenger worship is simply an offute or evolution of Norse paganism.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.700
Over the centuries, gods would fall out of favor or be forgotten and new gods would replace them.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.800
Proponents of this theory will often argue that many Avengers are reserved by new names.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.800
It is commonly believed among those who accept this theory that the epithet Captain America

01:36.800 --> 01:45.200
is a title awarded to Balder for a possible mythological role in guiding the Norse to America to evade religious persecution.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.500
Fitting both figures association with justice.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.600
Though no record of such a myth has been found.

01:51.700 --> 02:00.300
Critics of this theory argue that there is little consistency between the early Norse myths and later avenged myths beyond specific deities.

02:00.300 --> 02:08.500
If the other Avengers are supposed to be evolutions of Norse pagan figures then, why do they not consistently have roles in Raidnarek?

02:08.500 --> 02:12.100
A consistent event between both eras of Norse worship.

02:12.100 --> 02:19.500
Another theory is that a handful of Norse pagans, with but a fraction of their oral history, escaped Christian persecution

02:19.600 --> 02:23.100
and clung to worshiping what few is er, they still knew well.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.100
Forlucky and Odin.

02:25.100 --> 02:32.100
This long standing opposition to Christianity would make these remnants natural allies to avenger worshipers.

02:32.100 --> 02:38.500
Whose long standing rivals worshipers of the Justice League are often believed to be a Christian,

02:38.500 --> 02:42.300
offshoot venerating Moses under the name Superman.

02:42.300 --> 02:48.500
Critics of this theory often argue against the link between Christianity and legism.

02:48.600 --> 02:57.100
As well as pointing out that most attestations of the rivalry between Avengers and legists describe the relationship as remarkably civil.

02:57.100 --> 03:08.700
With conflicts often limited to scholarly debate, pitting Superman against Thor in hypothetical contests of strength or a ramen versus Batman in a battle of wits.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.100
Which would preclude any need to welcome a lies.

03:12.200 --> 03:20.200
A third theory takes the same assumption of a small group of Norse pagans with knowledge of only a fraction of their mythology.

03:20.200 --> 03:25.900
But takes a different assumption of how this group became integrated among Avenger worshipers.

03:25.900 --> 03:30.500
Hanging on the early American reputation as a haven for immigration.

03:30.500 --> 03:38.200
As new peoples and faiths emigrated to the American states, their religious icons were welcomed into the Avengers.

03:38.300 --> 03:44.500
Always in a position subservient to the national god of the American states, Captain America.

03:44.500 --> 03:49.700
Explaining Thor's subservience to the other deity in 20th century myths.

03:49.700 --> 03:56.800
This allowed America to exert control on the religion of new arrivals while still allowing them freedom of religion.

03:56.800 --> 04:06.200
Critics of this theory typically point to a lack of evidence that Captain America was ever a central figure in the recruitment of most or any Avenger.

04:06.300 --> 04:17.700
Some stories that describe the origin of the Pantheon even exclude him leading many historians to believe that Thor was considered an Avenger before Captain America was.

04:17.700 --> 04:25.200
These theories, their strengths and their flaws, will be examined in greater detail over the course of this paper.

04:25.200 --> 04:33.700
Alongside other less common answers to the burning questions about how Norse paganism survived and evolved over the centuries.
